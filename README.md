# 📦 Skip Selection UI Redesign

## ✅ Overview

This redesign of the "Choose Your Skip Size" screen modernizes the layout, improves visual hierarchy, and enhances user engagement. The goal was to make the selection process intuitive, accessible, and visually appealing—especially for users browsing quickly or from mobile devices.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Make the interface feel modern and high-end.
- Improve clarity of information (skip size, rules, price).
- Emphasize selected and restricted skips clearly.
- Use better visual contrast and content layering.

---

## 🎨 Key Visual & Functional Enhancements

### 1. **Image Treatment & Overlay**
- Introduced a subtle `linear-gradient(168deg, transparent 0, #0000008c 100%)` over skip images to improve readability for text placed on images.
- Creates a card "depth" effect for visual polish and clarity.

### 2. **Card Redesign**
- Cards have been restructured to resemble booking/tile systems seen in modern travel or SaaS apps.
- Added more padding and white space for breathability.
- Price tags have been moved and styled to feel premium (rounded pill shape, top-right corner float).
- Selected cards show a glowing CTA with strong contrast.

### 3. **Tag & Metadata Refinement**
- Tags like `Heavy Waste`, `Road Legal`, etc. now use color-coded pill badges for faster scanning.
- Tags are separated clearly to enhance scannability.

### 4. **Typography & Spacing**
- Font weights, sizes, and spacing have been adjusted for clarity and readability.
- Section headings are visually distinct from card content.
- Subheadings (e.g. hire period) appear less dominant, keeping the user's focus on key info.

### 5. **Improved CTA (Call To Action)**
- Unified button styles with proper hover and selection states.
- Clear call to action hierarchy (`Select This Skip` → `Selected` → `Continue`).
